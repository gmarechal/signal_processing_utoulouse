#  Tidal Waves

As you certainly noticed when you went to the french coast (Brittany, Charrente's or Aquitaine's coasts), the same beach can provide two very different landscapes at two different time during the day. This is due to tides. These tidal wave manifest by a cycle of on-shore/off-shore current accompagnied by a change of the foreshore limit (wet/dry sand, submerge/immerge transition). These tidal waves are crucial for the "breath of the coast" due to the presence of all the seaweed and micro-organism that compose the foreshore.

### Some history of the tide measurements

The first tide observations of the modern era were initiated in France toward the end of Louis XIV’s reign, in the wake of Newton’s work on gravitation, which provided a scientific foundation for understanding tides. One of the world’s oldest tide gauges was installed in the military port of Brest (Brittany) in 1846. Since then, the observatory has been regularly maintained and modernized, with only a temporary interruption following the bombings of 1944. Meanwhile, as the need to monitor and understand the marine environment increased, numerous other tide gauges were established around the world. Today, the Service Hydrographique Oceanographique de la Marine (SHOM) operate the tidal gauges along the french coasts.

 The principal of measuring tides rely on water level measurement. Back in the days, these measurements were collected manually from a scale fixed against harborss quays. Now these measurements are obviously more accurate and involve pressure sensor, water velocity (because tides induce currents), or radars.

### Tide is Key in Storm Surge.
 It is important to note that extreme or unexpected variations in water level measurements are not necessarily driven by tides alone. For instance, other atmospheric and oceanic processes can combine with the expected tidal signal, potentially leading to hazardous events. A striking example is the Xynthia storm that impacted the French Atlantic coast in 2010, causing damages estimated at around three billion euros and resulting in nearly one hundred deaths. The details on the physical processes involved can be found in  {cite:t}`bertin2012importance`.
